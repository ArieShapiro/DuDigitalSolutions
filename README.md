# ReactJS evaluation - Du Digital Solutions

## Intro

Welcome to our small evaluation test. :)

This is really nothing to be worried about. We just want to get a feeling for the level of experience you have with ReactJS to make sure we are all on the same page.

You don't have to solve all the tasks. If anything is not explained well enough or not clear to you, please feel free to contact and talk to us.
("DU" stands for the informal "you" in German, because we like to be familiar and talk to each other- so go ahead: ask us anything ;))

Actually completing the task should ususally not take more than 4-10 minutes.
Getting to know the code and getting into it, might add a little to that, as we all know:
So take your time and enjoy the challenge. ;)

If you have any questions, just send us a mail: jobs@du.digital

## How does it work:
We have created an example ReactJS application. The application shows a list of 4 small tasks to improve or fix the application itself.

* **Get the application working** (as described in [Getting started](#getting-started))

* **Take a look at the tasks and try to solve as many as possible.**
    Some should be pretty easy, others are a little more complicated.
    Don't worry or get frustrated if you can't solve all of them. We don't know everything either. This helps us to keep up with latest technology and also learn more complex stuff.
* **Solve the tasks**

* **Zip the result and attach it to an email**

* **Send mail to `jobs@du.digital` and let us know you are done**
  You can add questions or your comments. If you had a hard time with a task, we would love to show you our solution. ;)

## Getting Started

Clone this repository, install all the node modules and then start the react server:

Run `yarn dev` to start the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running tests

Run `yarn test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
